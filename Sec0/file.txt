The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?

Servant 
There is ten thousand--

MACBETH 
Geese, villain!

Servant 
Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH 
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

Servant 
The English force, so please you.

MACBETH 
Take thy face hence.

Exit Servant
